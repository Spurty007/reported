# Score Reporter for Hanover

A light weight webpage (form) for posting scores
Please review [hosting.md](hosting.md) as a guide for self hosting

## Maintenance

The only files you should ever need to edit are:
   * [Team.json](www/data/Team.json) - to reflect your teams
   * [post.php](www/post.php) - to post scores to your statistician
   * [Town.json](www/data/Town.json) - only if you're from a different league
   
## Help

I'm not selling this - its free software - if you get stuck, feel free to ask for help, however I can't give any indication of my level of awareness of your problems as I do not check GitHub daily.
