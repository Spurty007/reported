Please review [hosting.md](hosting.md) as a guide for self hosting

## Maintenance

The only file you should ever need to edit is the [Team.json](data/Team.json) file.

If you're from another league, you will want to edit [Town.json](data/Town.json) as well to reflect the towns in your league and have the mail sent to a different mailbox.

## Help

I'm not selling this - its free software - if you get stuck, feel free to ask for help, however I can't give any indication of my level of awareness of your problems as I do not check GitHub daily.
